# Peter Geipel's Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This app allows a user to enter a task into a one-hour period during business hours.  After pressing "Save", the task is saved, even when the page is refreshed.

During the course of the day, the color of the timeblocks will change, from green for future times, to red for the present, and finally gray for past events.
